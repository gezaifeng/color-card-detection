# color-card-detection
This project is used for color card edge range recognition and can be used for 24 color card image recognition and corresponding color extraction. 

It is divided into two parts: automatic and manual, both of which have visualization modules. If the automatic module identifies errors, the manual module can be replaced for manual annotation, recognition, and color extraction. 

The manual module uses the process of drawing a rectangular color card range on the original image after running, pressing enter to confirm, and recognizing the next image until all images are manually annotated, and the extracted colors will be visualized.
